1. WHAT IS DOSCRYPT AND FOR WHAT IS USED?
-----------------------------------------
    DOSCRYPTS is a program that encrypt/decrypts files for MS-DOS,
    made to demonstrate the use of the tiny-AES and SHA-256 C libraries
    for the cybersecurity master of the University of Seville.
    
2. SETUP AND USE OF DOSCRYPT
----------------------------
    DOSCRYPT doesn't need any setup at all. It works simply using the
    suitable version. In this moment, there are version for true 
    16-bit MS-DOS and modern 32-64 bits versions that works on 
    Windows.

    It's a very simple program, for example, typing DOSCRYPT.EXE /? 
    gives the following help screen:
    
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    |Encrypts or decrypts a file using AES-256.                       |
    |                                                                 |
    |Use:                                                             |
    |                                                                 |
    |DOSCRYPT.EXE [/?] [/D] [/S] [/V] [/P][passphrase] SOURCE DEST    |
    |                                                                 |
    |/?                     Shows this help screen.                   |
    |/D                     Decrypts the given file.                  |
    |/S                     Silent mode.                              |
    |/V                     Verbose mode.                             |
    |/P PASSPHRASE          Set the passphrase to encrypt or decrypt. |
    |SOURCE                 Source file to encrypt or decrypt.        |
    |DEST                   Encrypted or decrypted destination file.  |
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The program needs a source (file to encrypt/decrypt) and a
    destination file .
    
    Default mode is encryption mode. To decrypt a file, use the /D
    parameter.
    
    The /S parameter puts DOSCRYPT in silent mode. It will not echo
    anything to the screen or ask for user input.

    The /V parameter will show extra information on screen of the
    encrypt/decrypt process, like the file block size, the actual
    key used for the algorithm, the initialization vector and the
    padding applied to the last block of data.
    
    The /P parameter sets a passphrase to avoid ask it to the user.
    
3. RETURN CODES
---------------
    To make easy using this program with batch scripts, DOSCRYPTS returns
    a code with the following meaning:
        
        CODE 0 -> Program ended successfully.
        CODE 1 -> Help was displayed on screen.
        CODE 2 -> Invalid parameters send to the program.
        CODE 3 -> I/O error while reading/writing to file.
        CODE 4 -> Invalid file format detected.
        CODE 5 -> Invalid passphrase.
        CODE 6 -> Out of memory.

4. HOW DOSCRYPT WORKS
---------------------
    DOSCRYPT uses AES-256-CBC algorithm to encrypt/decrypt files.
    
    The key used in the algorithm is derived from the SHA-256 hash of the
    passphrase. It also generates a "random" IV vector for the algorithm.
    
    In every encrypted file, there is a file header that contains a 
    signature, a file version, the encrypt mode (only CBC for now), the IV
    vector and a encrypted magic word ("PASSPHRASEOK") to verify that the
    introduced passphrase is OK.
    
    Thanks to this header information, the program can decrypt any
    previous encrypted file when necessary.
